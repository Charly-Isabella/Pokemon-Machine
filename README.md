# Pokemon-Machine
Using Machine Learning with Pokemon Dataset


AIMS:
1. Build ML model to predict Pokemon Hit Points using other numerical variables
2. Allow user to input the details of an imaginary Pokemon; model should then predict the relevant Hit Points for that new Pokemon
3. Use categorical variables to predict Pokemon type
4. Allow user to input details of an imaginary Pokemon; model should then predict the relevant Type for that new Pokemon
